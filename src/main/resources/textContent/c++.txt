C++ is a general purpose programming language. It has imperative, object oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low level memory manipulation. It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers e.g. e-commerce, Web search or SQL servers, and performance critical applications e.g. telephone switches or space probes. C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.
